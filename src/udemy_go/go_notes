Variables can be initialized outside of a function but they cannot be assigned a value with the ':=' operator.
They will not run.

Go is a statically typed language.

only a variable of type string will be assigned to this variable.
long way of writing a variable in Go -> var card string = "Ace of Spades"

the go compiler figures out what type of data you are storing in the variable.
only use := when we are initializing a NEW VARIABLE.

function parameters in go need to be defined as well as the return type of the function.
